This is a quick and dirty ruby script to swap the current window to the other screen on a NVIDIA based dual monitor setup in gnome

Required packages in ubuntu:
* ruby
* xdotool
* nvidia-xconfig

TODO: 
* This only works with a specific style of NVIDIA setups
*   screen_width method needs to be more universal
